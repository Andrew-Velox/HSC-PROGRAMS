# HSC-PROGRAMS
## üìå About this repository
* Here you can find all the C programs of your HSC ICT book(chapter 5). There are 150 programs and most of them are similar to each other, but some of them are little difficult. It took me a month to finish this project. I coded all this C programs on my Android device & the app I used is called `Cxxdroid`. If you find any error then please inform me, that will help me to debug that code.
